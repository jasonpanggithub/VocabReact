This is an English Vocabulary Builder application. It uses Vocab2026API as the backend service and SQL Server as the primary data store.

The application supports both manual vocabulary entry and automatic vocabulary extraction from input text. It integrates with Google Dictionary to retrieve word definitions and related linguistic data.

Currently, the system implements a dictation feature. Additional functionalities are planned for future releases.
